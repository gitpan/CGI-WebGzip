CGI/WebGzip
===========

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

OVERVIEW

In PHP, you may write: ob_start("ob_gzhandler") and get all the output
GZip-ed automatically. CGI::WebGzip does the same thing. Is you include this module
in the beginning of your program, it whill capture all the output. When
the script ends, CGI::WebGzip compresses captured data and send it to browser.

If browser is incompatible with GZip encoding, output will not be captured,
and data will not be compressed.
